# blue-whale-phenology

Code and data used to generate the analyses and figures from Oestreich et al. (2021) Functional Ecology **"Acoustic signature reveals blue whale tune migration timing to oceanographic conditions"**.

The repository is organized as follows:
* **scripts:** All scripts for conducting analyses and generating figures.
* **data:** All acoustic and oceanographic data used in the analyses.
* **outputs:** Outputs from scripts (data tables and figures). This includes 2 files detailing the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure used to correct for multiple hypothesis testing (bh_correction_songpresence.csv & bh_correction_behaviorpresence.csv).

The full archive of passive acoustic monitoring data from the Monterey Bay Aquarium Research Institute's MARS hydrophone (used in this study) is available at: https://registry.opendata.aws/pacific-sound/
